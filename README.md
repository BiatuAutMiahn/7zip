# Warning, if using DoConsole/DoConsoleWait, the target process will attach to any parent console, and since this is a GUI app the console's prompt will never wait for the app to exit, it will return immediately. The target process will still write to the console, but you may not be able to interact with the target without the parent process recieving the same input.
